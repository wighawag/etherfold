**The storage seam NARROWS: `StateStore` is the reads, and a mutation nobody claimed for is no longer expressible** (ADR-0077 contracted, ADR-0079).

ADR-0075 put a writer token on every mutating path and ADR-0077 split the seam additively so consumers could migrate one at a time. This is the contract step, and it is one atomic change because narrowing a SHARED TYPE is atomic by construction: the moment `EntityEventProcessor`'s constructor takes the writable shape, every package that constructs it with a seam-typed value stops typechecking.

**Three names, one hierarchy.** `StateStore` is what a CONSUMER holds and is the reads only (`migrate`, the four reads, `readCursor`, `readRetentionEnforcement`, `capabilities`, `declarations`) -- calling `applyBlock` on one is now a compile error. `StateStoreBackend` is that plus the five mutating verbs: what a backend class declares, what a factory hands over. `WritableStateStore` is a backend plus the `token` a claim minted, and `openForWriting` is the only way to obtain one. The two scaffolding names from the expand phase, `ReadableStateStore` and `StateStoreMutations`, are DELETED.

**If you hold a store:** decide whether you READ or WRITE, and say so. A reader needs no change and gets a compile error if it tries to mutate. A writer claims: `const store = await openForWriting(await createBrowserStateStore(processor.entities))`. `openForWriting` migrates, so it replaces the `migrate()` you were calling, and it is idempotent per store instance, so the shipped `createState: () => store` pattern takes ONE claim and every generation writes through it. It takes a BACKEND and never a store already narrowed to its reads, so the narrowing is one-way; a demoted writer builds a new store and opens that (ADR-0078).

**If you implement a backend:** declare `implements StateStoreBackend` instead of `implements StateStore`. The classes themselves are UNCHANGED and keep their full surface, including the SQL tier's `queryCurrent` / `queryAsOf` / `applyBlocks` / `drop`; `createD1Store` still returns the concrete class.

**If you wire a browser app:** `createBrowserStateStore` still hands back a store and deliberately does NOT claim -- a tab that only renders opens the same database, and claiming there would have every reading tab take the store from the tab that is indexing. `createState` now returns a `WritableStateStore`, so wrap the factory in `openForWriting`. `openForWriting` / `openForReading` are re-exported from `@etherfold/processor-entities` beside the bootstrap primitives, because they are on the same boot path.

**If you run the conformance suite:** your factory and options are unchanged, and every chapter is asked ONCE again -- the two-shape parameterisation that existed while consumers migrated is gone.

Two consequences worth knowing before they surprise someone (both ADR-0079). Claiming MIGRATES, and a receiving container builds a generation's state before the generation cap can refuse it (the cap is keyed on the processor's version hash, which needs the processor, which needs the state), so a cap-refused generation now leaves an empty namespace behind; what a refusal still guarantees is no registry record and no state. And `VersionedStateEventProcessor` claims on FIRST USE rather than in its constructor, because claiming is asynchronous and that constructor is not -- still an explicit claim, and safe here because the store is one it built and nothing else holds.

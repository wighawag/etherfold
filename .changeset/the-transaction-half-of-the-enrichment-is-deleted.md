**`stream.alwaysFetchTransactions` and the `transaction` field it populated are DELETED, and there is no replacement.** This REMOVES A CAPABILITY. It is not deprecated, not aliased, not stubbed and not warned about: the flag is gone from `ProvidedStreamConfig`, `transaction?: LogTransactionData` is gone from the event type a processor is handed, and `LogTransactionData` itself, `transactionFetcherFor` and the `eth_getTransactionReceipt` calls under them are gone from `@etherfold/core`. Neither deployment shape of ADR-0003 can be configured into a per-transaction request any more: not the single-process `IndexerGeneration`, not the split `LogFetcher`.

**What went with it, exactly.** `from`, `gasUsed` and `effectiveGasPrice` were the three fields the flag bought, at ONE `eth_getTransactionReceipt` per distinct transaction in every fetched range, issued in a `for` loop unless the provider advertised `eth_batch`. A processor that never set the flag sees no behavioural change at all: it made no such call before and makes none now.

**What a processor that needed `from` should do instead: get it from somewhere other than this engine.** That is the honest answer and there is no better one hiding behind it. `from` is not on a log, `gasUsed` and `effectiveGasPrice` are not on a log, and no standard proposes putting them there, so this was never a compatibility fallback awaiting an upstream fix (`blockTimestamp` was, and it survives on the log). It was a permanent second data source, of precisely the kind the README's own Caveats tell a processor author not to depend on: anything costing an extra request per block or per transaction is expensive in the browser, which is the primary deployment (ADR-0002). Where the sender genuinely matters, the durable fix is on the CONTRACT side, emitting it in the event: an indexer cannot mint data the chain did not put in the log, and paying a round trip per transaction to fake that it can is what this deletes. ADR-0073 records the reasoning.

**No migration guide, because there is nothing to migrate to.** Backward compatibility with what has already been released is not an obligation of this project at its current stage, so no consumer is being preserved and no window is being offered. This entry is a factual record of what changed, not a compatibility promise.

`@etherfold/fetcher-host` no longer reads `STREAM_ALWAYS_FETCH_TRANSACTIONS`, and `platforms/nodejs-fetcher` no longer documents it: the variable set the flag that no longer exists, so it now names nothing and is ignored like any other unrecognised variable. `STREAM_FINALITY` and `STREAM_ALWAYS_FETCH_TIMESTAMPS` are untouched.

**On the stream identity.** The stream config is hashed into the stream digest, so dropping a field from it is an addressing change and not merely an API change. It costs nothing here: `resolveStreamConfig` omits keys whose value is `undefined`, so a deployment that never set the flag contributed no key to the digest preimage and its digest does not move (pinned as recorded bytes in `aDeletedStreamFlagDoesNotMoveTheDigest.test.ts`). A deployment that DID set it re-indexes from block 0, which is the correct outcome: the stream it stored contains transaction data that nothing reads any more.

The timestamp half of the enrichment is deliberately still standing and unchanged: `alwaysFetchTimestamps`, `enrichEvents`, `blockFetcherFor` and the block-timestamp cache are removed by a separate change, and the two were split so each lands green on its own.

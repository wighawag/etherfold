**`applyBlock` now refuses a height that is not ABOVE the recorded tip, on every backend, and no longer only a height that is already recorded.**

The old check was narrower than the invariant a single writer maintains. A caller reverts to the fork BEFORE it applies the branch that replaces it (`applyEventStream`, `@etherfold/processor-entities`), so every apply lands above what the store holds; a block offered at or below the tip is therefore a writer working from a position the store has passed -- a backgrounded tab resuming on a stale cursor, a second instance of one indexer -- and taking it would open a version underneath the live one rather than after it. That was reachable at any height nothing happened to be recorded at, which on a SPARSE block table (only blocks carrying our logs get a row) is most of them.

This is the tightening of a refusal and not a new capability, so a correct caller sees no change. It is the height half of `a-second-writer-writes-nothing`; the writer token is the other half, and the two answer different questions (WHO is writing, and WHETHER the height is above the tip).

- **An EMPTY store admits any height**, because there is no tip to be above: a fresh index at a contract's start block, a rebuild resuming mid-chain and a bootstrap installing a snapshot taken far above zero all still work unchanged.
- **The tip is read inside the same atomic unit as the write**, so a revert lowering it and an apply above it cannot interleave with another writer. On IndexedDB that is one more read in the `readwrite` transaction that was already open. On SQLite it is ADR-0054's shape, because `remote-sql` has no read inside a transaction: every statement of the block carries `NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM _blocks WHERE number > ?)`, so a refused block applies to NOTHING (versions and cursor included), and the tip read that opens the same batch is the evidence the message is assembled from.
- **The existing refusals are unchanged.** A duplicate height still raises where it always did, with the message it always had (on SQLite, still the `_blocks` primary-key violation), and so does a duplicate hash.
- **The message names both heights** on every backend, from one place at the seam: the new `blockNotAboveTip(number, tip)` in `@etherfold/state-store`. Like the duplicate-height refusal beside it, it is a plain `Error` and says the CALLER is wrong; `StoreWriterChangedError` remains the one on this path that means the opposite.

**If you run the conformance suite:** three cases join `a block is one atomic unit` -- a height at or below the tip is refused even where that height is free, an empty store admits any height, and a height becomes applicable again once a revert has taken the tip back under it.

**If you use `applyBlocks` (the SQL backend's packed backfill):** the blocks handed to it must now ASCEND, refused before anything is sent, because each is judged against the tip the one before it left. The lowest block is sent in a batch of its own, carrying the tip read that decides the whole sequence, so a refusal leaves NOTHING applied and costs one extra round trip per call rather than per block.

No runtime code changed in `@etherfold/processor-sqlite`, and nothing it does changed: one test there reads the statements of a block's batch, and the tip read now leads them.

**A store now reports whether its retention is actually ENFORCED against its storage**, so the one configuration nothing could detect -- a floor in force and nothing ever dropped -- is discoverable instead of silent.

Retention has two halves. `assertRetained` bounds what a read may ask about the moment a floor exists, and it runs on every read whatever the host does; `prune` physically drops what falls below that floor, and ADR-0022 makes it an explicit call the HOST schedules. Every host this project ships now prunes unconditionally, so the broken state is unreachable with a shipped host -- but a host that rolled its own indexing loop still gets the refusals of a bounded store and the footprint of an unbounded one, and until now the store's own report said nothing about it, because that report is about the CLAIM.

**The new read is `StateStore.readRetentionEnforcement()`**, a twelfth verb at the seam, answering one of three things: `{kind: 'no-floor'}` (`unbounded`, or `revert-only` with no declared finality depth -- nothing to enforce), `{kind: 'never-pruned', floor}` (a floor, and no pass has ever run), or `{kind: 'pruned', floor, prunedTo}` (a floor, and a pass ran at block `prunedTo`). `floor` is the floor as it stands NOW and `prunedTo` is the floor the last pass ran at, kept apart deliberately: the distance between them is how far behind a prune has fallen, and a store pruned once a year ago reports `pruned` with nothing but that gap to say so.

**It is asynchronous, and that is the design rather than an inconvenience.** The value is durable -- a store pruned before the process died must not come back saying never -- so it lives in storage, and `capabilities` is a synchronous getter documented as readable before `migrate` and before the database is open. Making it a capability field would have forced either an async `capabilities` (breaking every consumer) or an in-memory flag that resets on reload, which is a report that lies about the exact case it exists to catch. **`capabilities` is UNCHANGED**, so every existing consumer keeps compiling and keeps its pre-open readability.

**Two details worth knowing.** A pass is recorded whether or not it deleted anything, because a host pruning on a schedule deletes nothing on most cycles and treating "deleted something" as the evidence would make the healthy case the alarm. And whether a store has a floor is a fact about the SETTING, not about how far it has got, so a configured store that has applied no block yet reports `never-pruned` rather than `no-floor` -- it is exactly the store a misconfigured host is most likely to be holding.

The record rides the cursor port under `RETENTION_ENFORCEMENT_KEY`, as the snapshot origin does: a durable, unversioned, never-reverted, never-pruned slot, so this is one more key rather than a new table on four backends. On IndexedDB it commits in the SAME transaction as the deletion it describes.

**Every backend implements it and the conformance suite asks all of them**, cross-checking the report against the floor `prune` itself returned -- the suite cannot hold a fixed expectation, because only the store knows whether it has a floor at all. A new backend therefore inherits the obligation rather than rediscovering the hazard.

No default and no configuration shape changed, and nothing refuses: this is a report. ADR-0076 records why it replaced the construction-time refusal the originating spec launched with, and `work/notes/findings/a-worker-cannot-hold-a-timer-across-requests.md` is the platform constraint that ruled out the alternative.

`@etherfold/browser` is listed only because a store decorator in its tests implements the seam and therefore implements the new verb. Nothing it ships changed, and the hook still publishes no enforcement state on `syncing`.

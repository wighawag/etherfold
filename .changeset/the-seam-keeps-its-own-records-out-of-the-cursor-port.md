**The cursor port is now ENTIRELY the caller's: the seam keeps its own three records in a keyspace of its own** (ADR-0080).

Three facts the seam must not forget across a reload used to live at the cursor port under reserved key names: `snapshotOrigin` (where a bootstrapped store's rows came from, ADR-0028), `retentionEnforcement` (the floor the last prune ran at, ADR-0076) and `writerClaim` (the no-op a claim is taken by, ADR-0077). Each arrived as "one more key rather than a new port on four backends", and together they turned a namespace a CALLER chooses keys in into a shared one with a reserved list.

The collision that motivates this is silent in both of its dangerous forms. A caller that stored its own position under `snapshotOrigin` overwrote the marker, after which a bootstrapped store answered an as-of read below its snapshot -- about rows it does not have -- with `undefined`, which is an ordinary answer a caller acts on and which is wrong. A caller that chose `retentionEnforcement` made a pruned store report `never-pruned`. Neither looks like a failure.

So `writeCursor('snapshotOrigin', ...)` is now just a cursor with an odd name. **There are no reserved cursor keys, nothing refuses, and there is nothing to document or remember.**

**If you implement `StateStoreBackend` (the breaking part):** it grows three members, addressed by a CLOSED union of three keys rather than a caller-supplied string.

```ts
readSeamRecord(key: SeamRecordKey): Promise<string | undefined>;
writeSeamRecord(key: SeamRecordKey, value: string): Promise<void>;
clearSeamRecord(key: SeamRecordKey): Promise<void>;
```

They behave exactly as the cursor port's three do -- an opaque string, absent until written, a clear that is a no-op where nothing was written -- with one obligation: they must not share storage with the cursors, and `clearSeamRecord` must CLAIM on a backend reporting `singleWriter`, because that no-op is how `openForWriting` takes a store without touching a byte. The new conformance chapter `the seam's own records` asks all of it of every backend, including that a cursor of the same name disturbs nothing in either direction.

The port is on `StateStoreBackend` and never on `StateStore`, so a READER cannot reach it: the snapshot floor still arrives narrowed into `capabilities`, the prune record still arrives shaped as `readRetentionEnforcement`, and the claim is still `openForWriting`'s business.

**Removed exports:** `SNAPSHOT_ORIGIN_KEY`, `RETENTION_ENFORCEMENT_KEY` and `WRITER_CLAIM_KEY` from `@etherfold/state-store` (and the two that `@etherfold/processor-entities` re-exported). They existed so a host could AVOID them, which is the obligation this removes. **New exports:** the type `SeamRecordKey` and `SEAM_RECORD_KEYS`.

**If you use a store rather than implement one:** nothing to change, and one thing becomes safe that was not -- any cursor key you like.

**Storage, per backend.** IndexedDB's writer object store already had schemaless out-of-line keys, so it holds all four values and is renamed `seam` to say so; its `prune` transaction gets narrower, since the cursor store is no longer in it. SQLite gains a `_seam` table with the same two columns as `_cursor`, in the ADR-0053 table namespace with `_blocks`, `_cursor` and `_writer`, because each of these facts is about ONE generation's state. The reference store and the patch store gain a second `Map`. Nothing is migrated and nothing needs to be: no database of any of these shapes exists yet.

**Why not a guard on `writeCursor` instead**, which is the obvious fix: `openSnapshotAware` composes ABOVE the claim on the real boot path, so the snapshot layer writes its own marker THROUGH a claimed handle and is indistinguishable at runtime from a caller. Refusing reserved names there refuses the seam its own namespace and takes bootstrap down with it.

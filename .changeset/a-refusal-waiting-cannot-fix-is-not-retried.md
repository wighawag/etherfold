**A store refusal that waiting cannot fix now says so, and the browser indexing loop stops instead of retrying it for ever.**

The auto-index loop swallows a failure and comes back a few seconds later, which is right for a rate limit or a dropped socket and catastrophic for a refusal the store will repeat identically. A tab whose store had been moved ahead by another writer before it ever wrote got `block N is not above the recorded tip M`, treated it as transient, and re-fetched the whole range from the node on every tick: measured at ~90 `eth_getLogs` per second of wall clock, with the cursor pinned and nothing reported. The work was invisible precisely because each attempt merely failed again.

**The three block refusals are now errors carrying `retryable: false`** (`StoreWriteRefusedError`, `@etherfold/state-store`): a height already recorded, a hash already recorded, and a height the tip has passed. `StoreWriterChangedError` carries it too. They are read STRUCTURALLY (`err.retryable === false`), which is why `@etherfold/state-store` declares the flag while importing nothing — it has no dependencies, and an error crossing a package boundary still classifies correctly. The three messages also stop being copied into four backends: `blockNotAboveTip`, `blockAlreadyRecorded` and `blockHashAlreadyRecorded` are the one place that spells them.

`isRetryable` is now exported from `@etherfold/core` beside `RetryableError`, rather than being a private helper in `logFetcher.ts`, so every driver that retries on a timer asks the question the same way.

**If you catch these:** the messages and the class of failure are unchanged, and the refusals are still refusals — what is new is the flag and the shared `StoreWriteRefusedError` type. A loop of your own should ask `isRetryable(err)` before re-arming.

**A refused write stops the browser loop and is NOT a demotion.** It reports through `syncing.error` with id `WriteRefused` and leaves `syncing.demotion` alone, because the two mean opposite things: a demotion says this tab lost a race and should become a reader, while this says the write itself is wrong and the remedy is to revert first or stop. An app can tell them apart.

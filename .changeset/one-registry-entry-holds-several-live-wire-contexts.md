One named indexer receives logs for SEVERAL LIVE STREAMS at once, so a filter change can build a successor while the incumbent keeps being fed and keeps answering.

A FILTER or CONFIG change makes a NEW STREAM, and therefore a new `{source, config}` on the wire. With one receiver per name a successor on one could not receive a single log: `assertContext` refused its batches with the `400` that is deliberately not resumable, so it starved while the incumbent went on being fed. The route now selects the INDEXER by its segment and the batch's own `{source, config}` selects WHICH receiver inside it.

**`IndexerRegistryEntry` is now two questions rather than one field** (`@etherfold/server`). It was `{ingestion}`; it is now `liveIngestions(): Promise<readonly LogIngestion[]>` (one receiver per LIVE wire context, at most one per stream, since a stream is ONE address on the wire) and `canonicalGeneration(): Promise<GenerationId>` (which generation answers reads). Both are ASKED rather than read, because only the generation registry answers them honestly: a generation deleted elsewhere stops being live, and the canonical pointer moves, without a host being told.

```ts
// a host holding one receiver, unchanged in behaviour
getIndexer: indexerRegistry({alpha: myStreamBuilder}); // or singleContextEntry(myStreamBuilder)
// a host holding generations: the container answers both questions itself
getIndexer: (_c, name) => (name === 'alpha' ? myReceivingIndexer : undefined);
```

**`POST /{indexer}/ingest/expected-from-block` answers `{success, contexts: [{context, expectedFromBlock}, ...]}`**, one entry per live context, and no longer a single top-level `{expectedFromBlock, context}` pair. This is a deliberate RESPONSE-SHAPE change and the widening of what the route already did: it returned its `context` beside the number precisely so a sender knew which receiver it had reached, and one pair could only ever have named one of several — silently. It is also what lets one fetcher host later run one fetch loop per context, which is not built here.

**The ASK NAMES THE ASKER on the sending side.** `IngestionTarget.expectedFromBlock(context)` takes the `{source, config}` the sender pushes; `LogFetcher` passes its own, and `createHttpIngestion` finds its entry in the list. A list holding no entry for this sender is an `IngestionRefusedError` with code `context-mismatch` — non-retryable, raised before a single log is fetched, and the same fact as the `400` a foreign batch earns one round trip later (over HTTP this replaces the `WireContextMismatchError` the fetcher used to raise from the ask; both are fatal and neither is resumable). `createDirectIngestion` holds one receiver and ignores the argument.

**The refusal families are unchanged.** `409` is still the ONE resumable refusal, an unknown name is still `404`, a host with no registry is still `501`, and a context no live receiver holds is still a `400 context-mismatch`. What changed is that its `expected` field is now an ARRAY naming EVERY live context rather than a single one — the same choice `GenerationCapReachedError` makes when it names every deletable generation instead of picking one.

**A live context has a LIFETIME, and it is DERIVED FROM THE REGISTRY.** `ReceivingIndexer.add(spec)` builds a fold beside the ones already held — its own state, its own processor, its own receiver — and registers it, which is the moment its context becomes live; a cap refuses there, with nothing partial left behind. It stops being live when its generation is DELETED (and its stream reaped with it, if it was the last on it), and a batch for it is then the ordinary `400`. Deliberately NOT derived from the canonical pointer: a superseded generation is RETAINED under the caps, so "the successor became canonical" is not by itself a reason to stop feeding the old context, and what that rule should be stays a policy input rather than a rewrite of this routing.

**A second receiver on a stream already held is REFUSED.** A batch carries `{source, config}` and nothing that could tell two folds over one stream apart, so the second would be reachable only by iteration order. Such a fold is a PROCESSOR-change successor, and ADR-0044 already says how it advances: it re-folds the stream the writer stores, rather than being fed the same batches twice. `ReceivedGenerationSpec` accordingly takes `source` (and now a per-fold `stream` config), which is the only way to say "a different stream".

**Both feed views answer from the CANONICAL generation alone**, its stream and its fold read TOGETHER once per request, so a response can never pair one generation's stream with another's fold. A successor being fed under the same name is invisible to a consumer until the pointer moves; when it does, a cursor for the old stream meets the existing `400 stream-mismatch`, which is explicitly not a rewind.

`sameWireContext` is exported from `@etherfold/core`, because the host that selects a receiver must apply the same comparison the receiver would apply to refuse it — a second copy could select a receiver that then refused the batch.

`@etherfold/platform-nodejs` and `etherfold` carry no new behaviour: they pass the registry through, and each now builds the widened entry (one live context each) where it used to build `{ingestion}`.
